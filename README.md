A profile for archiso that includes many tools I use and a riced i3.

## Building

You will need to run this from an Arch system, with the `archiso` package installed.

```bash
mkarchiso cod
```

Alternatively, use [the online builder](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tallero/archiso-profiles/)

See the [archiso wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Archiso) for more info.

## Usage

Write the generated iso to a usb drive.

```bash
cp out/codarch-2022.08.23-x86_64.iso /dev/sdX
```
